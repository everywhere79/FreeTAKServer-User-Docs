We plan to do more than simply replicate the functionalities of the legacy TAK server. Check out our road map @FreeTakServer#25 to see what is planned. It includes a lot of cool ideas. We are doing it for free, because we believe that donating personal time to a cause is an endeavour that is worthy per-se, however, part-time, we are also spending our own money to: Maintain a public server and a test server Investing in different technologies for R&D If you feel that FTS is useful to you and you can donate in those challenging times, please consider sending a contribution here: DONATE You can also support the project by buying one of our T-Shirts NOTE: We are not a big fans of Paypal, but it is the easiest and most accessible way we have found for enabling some form of funding. We hope to implement a more ethical system in the future.

The API allows you to easily connect third parties to the TAK family, without the need to understand the complexity of the COT structure or what a TCP connection is. FTS also supports an Internal API . How FTS manages the information FTS will send the information coming trough the API to all the connected clients, addtionally it will save it to the persistency, to be query in future. List of supported API In the current release (1.9), FTS supports following API: ManageAPI/getHelp ManageGeoObject/postGeoObject ManageGeoObject/putGeoObject ManageGeoObject/getGeoObject ManageGeoObject/getGeoObjectByZone ManageEmergency/postEmergency ManageEmergency/getEmergency ManageEmergency/deleteEmergency ManageChat/postChatToAll ManageRoute/postRoute ManagePresence/postPresence ManagePresence/putPresence ManageVideoStream/postVideoStream Sensor/postDrone Sensor/postSPI /ManageKML/postKML General Configuration To quickly test the API, you can use a browser extension like ARC Advanced rest client (Chrome). REST APIs are easy to use, however they require a minimum ammount of knowledge, we DO NOT provide support to explain WHAT an API is. Please refer to an online tutorial such as this . Endpoint The API uses the following format: VERB [Protocol]://IP:PORT/APIName/action For example: POST http://104.58.20.216:9999/manageGeoObject/postGeoObject Authorization To use the API you need to have a REST API key. The authorization is placed in the header of the message. Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_API_KEY] You need to use the string 'Bearer' before YOUR_API_KEY A valid key is generated from FTS' CLI or, since 1.4 also from the Web UI, and stored into the DB. To add an API user in the CLI type: add_api_user See CLI help for details. To create a REST API key using the Web UI, go to the User section. To consume the API you will need to request a key to your FTS admin. The following is a non-working example of a key: { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer meg@secre7apip@guesmeIfyouCan\" } Message In most end points, the message is placed in the body of the request as JSON formatted. See below for detailed examples. In the API using the Get verbs it's a variable. API Details manageAPI Set of commands relative to API management. getHelp Retrieve API version and supported endpoints. * verb: GET * endpoint: /manageAPI/getHelp * returns: json containing API version and supported endpoints getHelp Example: return data (1.9.5) {\"APIVersion\": \"1.9.5\", \"SupportedEndpoints\": [\"/ManageNotification/getNotification\", \"/ManageVideoStream/deleteVideoStream\", \"/ManageVideoStream/postVideoStream\", \"/ManageVideoStream/getVideoStream\", \"/ManageSystemUser/putSystemUser\", \"/ManageEmergency/deleteEmergency\", \"/ManageGeoObject/postGeoObject\", \"/ManageEmergency/postEmergency\", \"/ManageGeoObject/getGeoObject\", \"/ManageGeoObject/putGeoObject\", \"/ManageEmergency/getEmergency\", \"/ManagePresence/postPresence\", \"/ManagePresence/putPresence\", \"/ManageRoute/postRoute\", \"/SystemUser/deleteSystemUser\", \"/SystemUser/postSystemUser\", \"/ManageChat/postChatToAll\", \"/ManageCoT/getZoneCoT\", \"/ManageKML/postKML\", \"/manageAPI/getHelp\", \"/Sensor/postDrone\", \"/Sensor/postSPI\", \"/BroadcastDataPackage\", \"/ManageVideoStream\", \"/AuthenticateUser\", \"/DataPackageTable\", \"/ManageGeoObject\", \"/ManageEmergency\", \"/FederationTable\", \"/ManagePresence\", \"/MissionTable\", \"/ExCheckTable\", \"/SendGeoChat\", \"/ManageRoute\", \"/checkStatus\", \"/GenerateQR\", \"/ManageChat\", \"/RecentCoT\", \"/APIUser\", \"/Clients\", \"/Sensor\", \"/MapVid\", \"/Alive\", \"/URL\"]} manageGeoObject A GeoObject is an element place on a map.

Detail has no special properties. Detail entities... The \"detail\" entity is intended to carry information that is specific to smaller communities of producers and consumers and require more intimate knowledge of the operating domain. For example, mensurated \"target\" events may come from dramatically different sources and need to propagate dramatically different \"detail\" information. A close-air-support mission will augment target details with initial point and callsign details to facilitate coordination of weapon delivery. In contrast, a mission planning system may augment planned targets with target catalog information and weapon fuzing requirements. Because the \"details\" portion of the event are of interest only to a subset of subscribers, that entity may be mentioned by reference when the event is communicated. This reduces the congestion when events are transmitted over bandwidth limited links and also prevents the retransmission of static data elements. ### detail attributes ## DimensionTypes ### DimensionTypes attributes Name Documentation space air land-unit land-equipment land-installation sea-surface sea-subsurface subsurface other ## DJI A class to handle DJI Drones ### DJI attributes Name Documentation spoiuid homelat gimbalroll gimbalpitch homelon gimbalyaw ## dxf This is a hook for an arbitrary 3D DXF description of a volume of space. ### dxf attributes Name Documentation level \"level\" is used to indicate the preferred ordering of multiple shape sub-schemas. For instance, if a polyline and ellipse are both present on the shape attribute, the one with the higher level value will be the \"more desirable\" representation of the object. This allows producers to provide alternative representation of an objects shape while ensuring that consumers will know which of the available representation is the best. (Note that not all consumers will implement all shape variations, hence the need for the allowing multiple shape objects.) See the documentation for shape/ellipse/@level for remarks on determining the precedence order when level values are equal or are missing. ## dxf ### dxf attributes Name Documentation level \"level\" is used to indicate the preferred ordering of multiple shape sub-schemas.

For instance, if a polyline and ellipse are both present on the shape attribute, the one with the higher level value will be the \"more desirable\" representation of the object. This allows producers to provide alternative representation of an objects shape while ensuring that consumers will know which of the available representation is the best. (Note that not all consumers will implement all shape variations, hence the need for the allowing multiple shape objects.) Since the level attribute is optional, it is necesary for precedence rules to exist to ensure all consumers process the shape definition the same way. The shape definition with the highest value level attribute is considered the most accurate interpretation. 2. If all shape definitions specify the same level, the order from least to most accurate interpretation is presumed to be ellipse, polyline, dxf. 3. A shape that specifies the level attribute has precedence over any that do not specify it. 4. If the level attribute is absent from all shape definitions, the order from least to most accurate interpretation is presumed to be ellipse, polyline, dxf. extrude A \"Height\" of the ellipse used to make the flat object encompas a volume. ## emergency An emergency beacon the is continually send to all the connected clients until deactivated from the original creator ### emergency attributes Name Documentation type default constructor def __init__(self): Alert cancel if true the emergency beacon is canceled ## EntityTypes ### EntityTypes attributes Name Documentation military civilian ## environment ### environment attributes Name Documentation temperature windDirection windSpeed ## Event represents a TAK event: this class is instantiated with a standard set of values. The opex field is intended to indicate that the event is part of a live operation, an exercise, or a simulation. For backward compatibility, absence of the opex indicates \"no statement\", which will be interpreted in an installation specific manner. opex=\"o- \" or \"e- \" or \"s- \", where \"- \" is optional. That is, it is permissible to specify only \"o\", \"e\", or \"s\" for the opex value. o = operations e = exercise s = simulation ### Event attributes Name Documentation how Gives a hint about how the coordinates were generated. It is used specifically to relay a hint about the types of errors that may be expected in the data and to weight the data in systems that fuse multiple inputs. version Schema version of this event instance (e.g. 2.0) time time stamp with respect to Zulu time indicating when an event was generated in extended ISO 8601 format in ProtoBuff expressed is in milliseconds type Event.type contains the Code for the Center on Target object. See here for more information . It Defines what the Event is about. An event may describe a physical object, a set of raw, unprocessed bits, or a tasking. # Hierarchically organized hint about event type ( default is 'a-f-G-I' for \"Friendly Ground infrastructure) The \"type\" attribute is a composite of components delimited by the semi-colon character. The first component of this composite attribute is defined below. Future versions of this schema will define other components which we expect will aid in machine filtering. Despite the exclusion of definitions for additional components in this version of the schema, users of this schema should expect and design an optional trailing field delimited by the semi-colon character. This field can be ignored. - component1 ;optional field The first component (component1) is a hierarchically organized hint about type. The intention is that this hierarchy be flexible and extensible and facilitate simple filtering, translation and display. To facilitate filtering, the hierarchy needs to present key fields in an easily parsed and logical order. To facilitate this, this component is a composite of fields separated by the \"-\" punctuation character, so a valid type would be: x-x-X-X-x. Using a punctuation for field separation allows arbitrary expansion of the type space, e.g., a-fzp-mlk-gm-... Field meanings are type specific. That is, the third field of an \"atom\" type may represent air vs. ground while the same field for a \"reservation\" type may represent purpose. MEANING of 'a' in the first position The \"Atoms\" portion of the type tree requires some additional explanation past the taxonomy defined below. The \"Atoms\" portion of the type tree contains CoT defined fields and part of the MIL-STD-2525 type definition. To distinguish MIL-STD-2525 type strings from CoT defined fields, the MIL-STD-2525 types must be represented in all upper case. Differentiation of type namespace with upper/lower case facilitates extension of CoT types and MIL-STD-2525 types without name space conflict. An example: a-f- A-B-C -x - a = Atom - f = attitude or disposition (friendly in this case) - A-B-C =the SDIC 2525 separated by dashs - x = COT specific extension The organization of CoT and MIL-STD-2525 types can be determined from the taxonomy below, but additional details are provided here. The \"Atoms\" portion of the \"type\" tree contains the \"Battle Dimension\" and \"Function ID\" fields taken from MIL-STD-2525. \"Battle Dimension\" is a single character taken from MIL-STD-2525 and is located in the position 5. a-.- G -I-M-N-B - P - Space - A - Air - G - Ground - S - Sea Surface - U - Sea Subsurface - SF - Special Operations Forces The typical 2525 representation for \"Function ID\" is three groups of two characters separated by a space (e.g. \"12 34 56\"). The CoT schema maps this to a \"-\" delimited list of characters. (e.g. \"1-2-3-4-5-6\"). The concatenation of the \"Battle Dimension\" and \"Function ID\" fields from the MIL-STD-2525 specification represented in the CoT schema will be as follows: battle dimension-func id char1-func id char2- ... -func id char6 When an appropriate MIL-STD-2525 type exists, it should be used. If there is a MIL-STD-2525 representation which is close, but may be refined, a CoT extension to the 2525 type can be appended. for example: a-h-X-X-X-X-X- i might represent hostile MIL-STD-2525 type X-X-X-X-X of Israeli (the 'i' ) manufacture. Again, the CoT extension uses lower case. Conceptually, this extension defines further branching from the nearest MIL-STD-2525 tree point. If no appropriate 2525 representation exists, a type definition can be added to the CoT tree defined here. The resulting definition would be represented in all lower case. For example a-h-G-p-i might define atoms-hostile-Ground-photon cannon-infrared. The taxonomy currently looks like this: Note that the coding of the sub fields are determined entirely by the preceding fields!) The current type tree is defined here. +--- First position, this event describes - a - Atoms - this event describes an actual \"thing\" +--- 2nd CoT affiliation of these atoms - p - Pending - u - Unknown - a - Assumed friend - f - Friend - n - Neutral - s - Suspect - h - Hostile - j - Joker - k - Faker - o - None specified - x - Other +--- Battle dimension stale The \"stale\" attribute defines the ending time of the event's validity interval. The start and stale fields together define an interval in time. It has the same format as time and start. ending time when an event should no longer be considered valid l (with respect to Zulu time in extended ISO 8601 format) In protobuff is in milliseconds uid The \"uid\" attribute is a globally unique name for this specific piece of information. Several \"events\" may be associated with one UID, but in that case, the latest (ordered by timestamp), overwrites all previous events for that UID. can have additional information attached. [EventTYPE].[MACHINESENDERID].Nichname.UniqueID e.g. - ping means that this event is a ping, GeoChat indicates a chat type structure. The UID should be in the following format: GeoChat. . . . Diverging from this format should not cause significant issues; however, the UID is used as a fallback if other information cannot be parsed from the message, so issues may still be experienced. If uid does not contain any \u201c.\u201d characters, the chat room will default to \u201cAll Chat Rooms\u201d. GeoChat.ANDROID-7C:91:22:E8:6E:4D.DIPPER.44bf77cd-289e-4ea4-8756-ce295de168ca start format - DTG The \"start\" attribute defines the starting time of the event's validity interval. The start and stale fields together define an interval in time. It has the same format as time and stale. starting time of the event's validity interval (with respect to Zulu time in extended ISO 8601 format) . As different from the moment in which the element was generated in protobuff this is expressed in milliseconds access Specifies access controls that should be applied to the event opex OPTIONAL: Specifies whether the event is part of a live operation, an exercise, or a simulation. The access field is intended to indicates who has access to this event. (e.g. unrestricted, nato, army, coalition...) It is currently defined as a string, and is optional in V2.0. Future version of the event schema will provide formal definition of this field. qos OPTIONAL: Specifies a quality of service desired from applications processing or routing the event ## filename ### filename attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## fillColor ### fillColor attributes Name Documentation value ## FilterGroup the name of the group authorized to see the CoT ### FilterGroup attributes ## group ### group attributes Name Documentation role name uid unique ID of the group ## hash ### hash attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## Hierarchy ### Hierarchy attributes ## IdentityTypes ### IdentityTypes attributes Name Documentation pending pending unknown unknown friend friend neutral hostile assumed-friend suspect joker faker ## image This is a Cursor On TargeClass for abstract image product metadata. It is specifically limited to geographically located (though not necessarily geographically registered) image products. It is not intended to contain all the meta data typically found in the NITF header associated with such images, but rather provides sufficient \"hints\" about the ISR product to facilitate collection queuing and ipl searching. Full meta data will reside in the NITF header or other IPL-specific schemas. This class borrows from the NITF standard. Note, also, that this class presumes is is contained within a CoT Evebnt element which provides information about center poiint, etc. Similarly, the CoT_shape schema can be used to delimit the bounds of the image. Furthermore, this element may conatin a base64 encoded image file. In this case, the 'mime' attribute should indicate the image type. ### image attributes Name Documentation type Image type, drawn from NITF specification. E.g., SL - side-looking radar, TI - thermal infrared, FL - forward looking infrared, RD - radar, EO - electro-optical, OP - optical, HR - high resolution radar, HS - hyperspectral, CP - color frame photography, BP - black/white frame photography, SAR - synthetic aperture radar, SARIQ - SAR radio hologram, IR - infrared, MS - multispectral, ... georegistered (DEPRECATED) True if this image has been properly geo-registered source (REVISED) The source of this image, specifically the CoT UID of the producer. (The intention is to indicate equipment type used to collect imagery, not organization owning image.) resolution Image product resolution (expressed in meters per pixel) url URL link to image if the image is not embedded version Version tag for this sub schema. Neccessary to ensure upward compatibility with future revisions. size Approximate image file size (bytes) analysis (DEPRECATED) True if image analysis (e.g., markup) is available mime If an in-lined image is contained in this entity, then this attribute describes the mime type of that image. The actual image data will be base64 encoded. See http://www.w3schools.com/media/media_mimeref.asp for list of common mime types. width The width of the image (in pixels) height The height of the image (in pixels) reason (NEW) The reason this image was originally produced (BHA, BDA, ISR, ...) Coding is TBD but will reflect the CoT type coding structure. E.g., a-d-b Assesment-Damage-Bomb, etc... bands Number of data bands within the image. For example, an RGB image as 3 bands (Red, Green, Blue bands/channels) mimecsv Used only if the attribute 'mime' references a container type (e.g., image/x-nitf21). In this case, 'mimecsv' holds a list of Comma Separated Values to supplement the MIME type in the mime field. Nominally, the values in 'mimecsv' wil lbe mime types of the elements in the composite image. For example, if 'mime' 'image/x-nitf21', then 'mimecsv' may hold 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpeg2000', or 'image/x-eagleeye'. quality This expresses how the tradeoff between image quality and compression were made for this image. This is usually a 'relative' quality measure, an unsigned floating point value between 0.0 (highest compression) and 0 (highest quality). Implementers should attempt to map this scalar value to an approximate linear progression of visual quality as determined on a typical sample image. If the field's value carries an explicit sign (+/-) including +0 or -0, it represents the exact value expressed in a range appropriate to the compression type expressed in 'mime' or 'mimecsv'. For example, with 'image/x-eagleeye' the EagleEye clip setting, the quality setting may range from -4096.0 to +4096.0. ## Input this class can drive input filtering without auth messages. ### Input attributes Name Documentation name Protocol Port auth Previously the only valid value for the \u201cauth\u201d attribute was \u201cldap\u201d. \u201cfile\u201d is now another valid value. ## keywords ### keywords attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## labels_on ### labels_on attributes Name Documentation value ## link This is a Cursor On Target Class for linking to either another CoT event or an arbitrary Internet resource. The objective of this class is to provide an abstract way to express a relationship between a CoT object and other object. This allows, for example, a sensor point of interest to be linked back to its source, or a PPLI from a wingman to be associated with his flight lead. Linkages are always unidirectional. One entity may have multiple links (i.e., it may be related to multiples other entities). For processing simplicity, it is required that the relationship graphs will directed and acyclic (no cycles). The link, itself, names the relationship (using a hierarchy similar to the CoT type), the UID of the related object (whether CoT or not), possibly provides a URL for retrieving that object. links are used for example in routes. ### link attributes Name Documentation uid production_time the time in which this link has been produced (e.g. \"2020-11-26T14:19:02Z\") relation The type of relationship (e.g, subject, object, indirect object) that this link describes. This is a hierarchy much like the event type field. Common values: \"c\" type The CoT type of the referenced MIL 2525 object. This is included because it is generally the key item needed in a tasking. Common types are: - Control Point: \"b-m-p-c\" - Waypoint : \"b-m-p-w\" url If present, this is a URL through which the linked object can be retrieved. If the URL is missing, then the object should be a periodic message (e.g., blue force track) that can be read from a CoT stream. parent_callsign the call sign of the client that produced this link remarks Remarks associated with this link. mime Internet Media type of the referenced object. If the link is to a CoT event, the mime attribute is optional and its type may be application/xml or text/xml as described in RFC 3023, \"XML Media Types\", or the unregistered type, application/cot+xml. If the link is to an arbitrary resource, the mime attribute is required and and appropriate Internet media type must be specified. Registered media types are managed by the IANA and are listed at http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/. version Version tag for this sub schema.

If this element is not included, the server will interpret this as a message to all recipients, and the message will be sent to everyone, and depending upon the client software, this could mean a private message would be displayed publicly. ### Marti attributes ## mimeType ### mimeType attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## mission ### mission attributes Name Documentation type tool name authorUid ## Mission Represent a TAK Mission ### Mission attributes Name Documentation name server description ## MissionChange ### MissionChange attributes ## MissionChanges ### MissionChanges attributes ## missionName ### missionName attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## MissionType ### MissionType attributes Name Documentation CREATE CHANGE ## name ### name attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## point ### point attributes Name Documentation lat Latitude referred to the WGS 84 ellipsoid in degrees lon Longitude referred to the WGS 84 in degrees ce Circular area around the point defined by lat and lon fields in meters. Although named ce, this field is intended to define a circular area around the event point, not necessarily an error (e.g. Describing a reservation area is not an \"error\"). If it is appropriate for the \"ce\" field to represent an error value (e.g. event describes laser designated target), the value will represent the one sigma point for a zero mean normal (Guassian) distribution. le Linear Error in meters associated with the HAE field. Although named le, this field is intended to define a height range about the event point, not necessarily an error. This field, along with the ce field allow for the definition of a cylindrical volume about the point. If it is appropriate for the \"le\" field to represent an error (e.g. event describes laser designated target), the value will represent the one sigma point for a zero mean normal (Guassian) distribution. A height range about the event point in meters associated with the HAE field. When used to represent error, the value represents the one sigma point for a zero mean normal (Gaussian) distribution. hae Height above Ellipsoid based on WGS-84 ellipsoid (measured in meters) HAE acronym for Height above Ellipsoid based on WGS-84 ellipsoid (measured in meters). ## polyline The poly line provides a mechanism to express arbitrarily complex two-dimenstional shapes. This is used for representing oddly shaped objects such as exclusion zones, etc. Though generally closed, it is not necessarily a closed line, thus allowing polyline to represent objects such as phasing lines, etc. ### polyline attributes Name Documentation vertex level \"level\" is used to indicate the preferred ordering of multiple shape sub-schemas. For instance, if a polyline and ellipse are both present on the shape attribute, the one with the higher level value will be the \"more desirable\" representation of the object. This allows producers to provide alternative representation of an objects shape while ensuring that consumers will know which of the available representation is the best. (Note that not all consumers will implement all shape variations, hence the need for the allowing multiple shape objects.) See the documentation for shape/ellipse/@level for remarks on determining the precedence order when level values are equal or are missing. closed True if the list of verticies should be considered a closed polygon (an implicit line will be added from vertex N to vertex 0). ## Precisionlocation some type of location? ### Precisionlocation attributes Name Documentation altsrc TDB can be DTED0 or ??? geopointsrc PRECISE_IMAGE_FILE PRECISE_IMAGE_FILE_X PRECISE_IMAGE_FILE_Y ## remarks This is a Cursor On TargetClass for a generic remarks (aka \"FreeText\"). Provides a place to annotate CoT with free text information. e.g. comments from other users about the current COT. Used also for the geoChat. the xml body of this class is used to transport the chat message While the use of free text is strongly discouraged (it hampers machine-to-machine communication) it is a pragmatic necessity. This entity attempts to encapsulate freetext in a way that simplifies subsequent machine processing. The content of this entity is presumed to be a human-readable chunk of textual data. The attributes merely aid in the machine handling of the data. ### remarks attributes Name Documentation time the time of the remark was added to the CoT object to Intended recipeint(s) of this remark information. Tentative field coding as follows: The to attribute may contain the UID of the entity to whom the message is addressed. (Implementors should expect that future versions of this sub schema will allow a comma separated list of UIDs.) Absense of an explict addressee means the message is broadcast. e.g. ANDROID-359975090666199 source Source specifies the sender\u2019s UID \u2013 this is what is parsed by recipients to determine the sender, with the UID format being the fallback. version Version tag for this sub schema. Neccessary to ensure upward compatibility with future revisions. keywords Used to track a conversation thread. The format is a comma-separated list of freetext keywords. ex. keywords=\"debriefing\" - Describes a conversation about debriefing ex. keywords=\"mission-A\" - Describes a conversation about mission-A ex. keywords=\"tasking_B, subject_C\" - Describes a conversation about tasking_B and subject_C sourceID ## request This is a Cursor On Target sub-schema for a generic request. This schema contains information common to all requests, specifically where responses should be sent, the overall priority of the request, if immediate willco/cantco acknowledgement is needed, etc. Detail information for specific request types are carried in sub-schemas nested within this one. Notice that this is not the same as in TAKRequest ### request attributes Name Documentation notify Network endpoint to which status notifications should be delivered. (A network endpoint is represented as an URL, e.g., tcp://hostname:port, udp://hostname:port. The previous format, host:port, e.g., 192.168.0.1:71556, is deprecated, but implementers should be aware that this format may be in use. wilcoby An optional field that requests the receiving system to provide a positive or negative akcnowledgement (WILCO/CANTCO) by a specific time. This is used to ensure that deadline driven requests are made known to the operator. priority This optional field indicates this request's relative priority with respect to other requests. (At present, no specific coding scheme is in mandated, but a floating point value between 0.0(low) and 0(high) is in current (limited) use.) version Version tag for this sub schema. Neccessary to ensure upward compatibility with future revisions. to When present, this field contains the CoT UID of the specific entity who is being addressed. It is assumed that all CoT entities that can provide a service are reported as friendly atoms. authority This is a 'signature block' which holds the CoT uid of the entity which has uathorized the request. The authorizing entity is not necessarily the originator of the request and might not be associated with the 'notify' field. Authority is intended to provide services (such as a striker) a mechanism to verify that the request has been approved. streamto ## route ### route attributes Name Documentation sender ## route_fil ### route_fil attributes Name Documentation Infil Exfil ## route_method ### route_method attributes Name Documentation Driving Walking Flying Swimming Watercraft ## route_order ### route_order attributes Name Documentation Ascending Check Points Descending Check Points ## route_routetype ### route_routetype attributes Name Documentation Primary Secondary ## routeinfo ### routeinfo attributes Name Documentation __navcues ## sensor This is (the root class of) a Cursor On Target sub-schema for a steerable, staring sensor such as EO, IR, or Radar sensor. The root class is intended to capture only information on the sensor's orientation and field of view is. Details about it's spectrum, sensitivity, resolution, modality, performance, etc., should be captured in a \"derived\" subschema for that particular type of sensor. All orientation attributes associated with sensor are normalized to an geodedic frame of reference, removing platform factors such as roll, pitch, yaw, etc. Therefore an \"azimuth\" of 0 means the sensor is pointed north regardless of its platform heading or attitude. ### sensor attributes Name Documentation elevation version Version tag for this sub schema.

E.g., LANTRIN, TARPS, etc. fov field of view roll fovBlue displayMagneticReference range fovGreen fovAlpha hideFov fovRed azimuth ## shape This is a Cursor On Target sub-schema for a generic shape description. Many objects are not adequately represented by the simple \"point\" object in the CoT base schema. However, it is counterproductive to burden all CoT applications to understand arbitrary shapes, so \"shape\" is an optional attribute that can be used to communicate between shape-aware apprications. The \"point\" object in the base schema must still be populated and the CE and LE fields in the point entity must be set such that the point completely encloses the area described in any shape entity in the detail section. (This is needed so that CoT applications can quickly filter out objects that are clearly outside an area of interest. ### shape attributes Name Documentation ellipse The \"ellipse\" is a common shape abstraction used by many geomanipulation applications; it is supported natively. link polyline The poly line provides a mechanism to express arbitrarily complex two-dimenstional shapes.

It has two required attributes: course and speed. It also has optional attributes for specifying the vertical component of the motion vector (slope) and errors associated with course, speed, and slope. Course denotes the direction of motion and is specified as the number of degrees measured clockwise from true North. Speed is specified in meters per second as speed over ground. There is no constraint on the precision used for these values. ### track attributes Name Documentation speed eCourse 1-sigma error on a Gaussian distribution associated with the course attribute course eSpeed 1-sigma error on a Gaussian distribution associated with the speed attribute eSlope 1-sigma error on a Gaussian distribution associated with the slope attribute version ## type ### type attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## uastool ### uastool attributes Name Documentation extendedCot activeRoute ## uid This is a Cursor On Target detail Class that holds the unique ID assigned by each system that processed this event. Most systems (including CoT) have their own method for assigning system-wide unique identifiers for a particular object. In general, it is not possible for a single UID to be used for all systems. This 'uid' entity provides a common place where each systems can record its particular UID for each CoT event. Like the _flow-tags_ element, each system is responsible for adding its own attribute to this entity. The name of the attribute should represent the system, and the value of the attribute should be the id that system assigned to this CoT object. ### uid attributes Name Documentation version Droid TBD, maybe from Android? ## uid special class used in mission only for ID ### uid attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## usericon the image used to display the COt ### usericon attributes Name Documentation iconsetpath the path of the icon image used MIL 2525 STD - COT_MAPPING_2525B/a-u/a-u-G ICON - 34ae1613-9645-4222-a9d2-e5f243dea2865/Military/EA-6B.png - 'f7f71666-8b28-4b57-9fbb-e38e61d33b79/Google/hiker.png'/ in alternative for a spot - COT_MAPPING_SPOTMAP/b-m-p-s-m/-65536 ## vehicle ### vehicle attributes Name Documentation goHomeBatteryPercent hal flightTimeRemaining typeTag batteryRemainingCapacity isFlying flightTime type batteryMaxCapacity voltage ## vertex ### vertex attributes Name Documentation hae Height Above Ellipsoid (HAE) in Meters.

Detail has no special properties. Detail entities... The \"detail\" entity is intended to carry information that is specific to smaller communities of producers and consumers and require more intimate knowledge of the operating domain. For example, mensurated \"target\" events may come from dramatically different sources and need to propagate dramatically different \"detail\" information. A close-air-support mission will augment target details with initial point and callsign details to facilitate coordination of weapon delivery. In contrast, a mission planning system may augment planned targets with target catalog information and weapon fuzing requirements. Because the \"details\" portion of the event are of interest only to a subset of subscribers, that entity may be mentioned by reference when the event is communicated. This reduces the congestion when events are transmitted over bandwidth limited links and also prevents the retransmission of static data elements. ### detail attributes ## DimensionTypes ### DimensionTypes attributes Name Documentation space air land-unit land-equipment land-installation sea-surface sea-subsurface subsurface other ## DJI A class to handle DJI Drones ### DJI attributes Name Documentation spoiuid homelat gimbalroll gimbalpitch homelon gimbalyaw ## dxf This is a hook for an arbitrary 3D DXF description of a volume of space. ### dxf attributes Name Documentation level \"level\" is used to indicate the preferred ordering of multiple shape sub-schemas. For instance, if a polyline and ellipse are both present on the shape attribute, the one with the higher level value will be the \"more desirable\" representation of the object. This allows producers to provide alternative representation of an objects shape while ensuring that consumers will know which of the available representation is the best. (Note that not all consumers will implement all shape variations, hence the need for the allowing multiple shape objects.) See the documentation for shape/ellipse/@level for remarks on determining the precedence order when level values are equal or are missing. ## dxf ### dxf attributes Name Documentation level \"level\" is used to indicate the preferred ordering of multiple shape sub-schemas.

For instance, if a polyline and ellipse are both present on the shape attribute, the one with the higher level value will be the \"more desirable\" representation of the object. This allows producers to provide alternative representation of an objects shape while ensuring that consumers will know which of the available representation is the best. (Note that not all consumers will implement all shape variations, hence the need for the allowing multiple shape objects.) Since the level attribute is optional, it is necesary for precedence rules to exist to ensure all consumers process the shape definition the same way. The shape definition with the highest value level attribute is considered the most accurate interpretation. 2. If all shape definitions specify the same level, the order from least to most accurate interpretation is presumed to be ellipse, polyline, dxf. 3. A shape that specifies the level attribute has precedence over any that do not specify it. 4. If the level attribute is absent from all shape definitions, the order from least to most accurate interpretation is presumed to be ellipse, polyline, dxf. extrude A \"Height\" of the ellipse used to make the flat object encompas a volume. ## emergency An emergency beacon the is continually send to all the connected clients until deactivated from the original creator ### emergency attributes Name Documentation type default constructor def __init__(self): Alert cancel if true the emergency beacon is canceled ## EntityTypes ### EntityTypes attributes Name Documentation military civilian ## environment ### environment attributes Name Documentation temperature windDirection windSpeed ## Event represents a TAK event: this class is instantiated with a standard set of values. The opex field is intended to indicate that the event is part of a live operation, an exercise, or a simulation. For backward compatibility, absence of the opex indicates \"no statement\", which will be interpreted in an installation specific manner. opex=\"o- \" or \"e- \" or \"s- \", where \"- \" is optional. That is, it is permissible to specify only \"o\", \"e\", or \"s\" for the opex value. o = operations e = exercise s = simulation ### Event attributes Name Documentation how Gives a hint about how the coordinates were generated. It is used specifically to relay a hint about the types of errors that may be expected in the data and to weight the data in systems that fuse multiple inputs. version Schema version of this event instance (e.g. 2.0) time time stamp with respect to Zulu time indicating when an event was generated in extended ISO 8601 format in ProtoBuff expressed is in milliseconds type Event.type contains the Code for the Center on Target object. See here for more information . It Defines what the Event is about. An event may describe a physical object, a set of raw, unprocessed bits, or a tasking. # Hierarchically organized hint about event type ( default is 'a-f-G-I' for \"Friendly Ground infrastructure) The \"type\" attribute is a composite of components delimited by the semi-colon character. The first component of this composite attribute is defined below. Future versions of this schema will define other components which we expect will aid in machine filtering. Despite the exclusion of definitions for additional components in this version of the schema, users of this schema should expect and design an optional trailing field delimited by the semi-colon character. This field can be ignored. - component1 ;optional field The first component (component1) is a hierarchically organized hint about type. The intention is that this hierarchy be flexible and extensible and facilitate simple filtering, translation and display. To facilitate filtering, the hierarchy needs to present key fields in an easily parsed and logical order. To facilitate this, this component is a composite of fields separated by the \"-\" punctuation character, so a valid type would be: x-x-X-X-x. Using a punctuation for field separation allows arbitrary expansion of the type space, e.g., a-fzp-mlk-gm-... Field meanings are type specific. That is, the third field of an \"atom\" type may represent air vs. ground while the same field for a \"reservation\" type may represent purpose. MEANING of 'a' in the first position The \"Atoms\" portion of the type tree requires some additional explanation past the taxonomy defined below. The \"Atoms\" portion of the type tree contains CoT defined fields and part of the MIL-STD-2525 type definition. To distinguish MIL-STD-2525 type strings from CoT defined fields, the MIL-STD-2525 types must be represented in all upper case. Differentiation of type namespace with upper/lower case facilitates extension of CoT types and MIL-STD-2525 types without name space conflict. An example: a-f- A-B-C -x - a = Atom - f = attitude or disposition (friendly in this case) - A-B-C =the SDIC 2525 separated by dashs - x = COT specific extension The organization of CoT and MIL-STD-2525 types can be determined from the taxonomy below, but additional details are provided here. The \"Atoms\" portion of the \"type\" tree contains the \"Battle Dimension\" and \"Function ID\" fields taken from MIL-STD-2525. \"Battle Dimension\" is a single character taken from MIL-STD-2525 and is located in the position 5. a-.- G -I-M-N-B - P - Space - A - Air - G - Ground - S - Sea Surface - U - Sea Subsurface - SF - Special Operations Forces The typical 2525 representation for \"Function ID\" is three groups of two characters separated by a space (e.g. \"12 34 56\"). The CoT schema maps this to a \"-\" delimited list of characters. (e.g. \"1-2-3-4-5-6\"). The concatenation of the \"Battle Dimension\" and \"Function ID\" fields from the MIL-STD-2525 specification represented in the CoT schema will be as follows: battle dimension-func id char1-func id char2- ... -func id char6 When an appropriate MIL-STD-2525 type exists, it should be used. If there is a MIL-STD-2525 representation which is close, but may be refined, a CoT extension to the 2525 type can be appended. for example: a-h-X-X-X-X-X- i might represent hostile MIL-STD-2525 type X-X-X-X-X of Israeli (the 'i' ) manufacture. Again, the CoT extension uses lower case. Conceptually, this extension defines further branching from the nearest MIL-STD-2525 tree point. If no appropriate 2525 representation exists, a type definition can be added to the CoT tree defined here. The resulting definition would be represented in all lower case. For example a-h-G-p-i might define atoms-hostile-Ground-photon cannon-infrared. The taxonomy currently looks like this: Note that the coding of the sub fields are determined entirely by the preceding fields!) The current type tree is defined here. +--- First position, this event describes - a - Atoms - this event describes an actual \"thing\" +--- 2nd CoT affiliation of these atoms - p - Pending - u - Unknown - a - Assumed friend - f - Friend - n - Neutral - s - Suspect - h - Hostile - j - Joker - k - Faker - o - None specified - x - Other +--- Battle dimension stale The \"stale\" attribute defines the ending time of the event's validity interval. The start and stale fields together define an interval in time. It has the same format as time and start. ending time when an event should no longer be considered valid l (with respect to Zulu time in extended ISO 8601 format) In protobuff is in milliseconds uid The \"uid\" attribute is a globally unique name for this specific piece of information. Several \"events\" may be associated with one UID, but in that case, the latest (ordered by timestamp), overwrites all previous events for that UID. can have additional information attached. [EventTYPE].[MACHINESENDERID].Nichname.UniqueID e.g. - ping means that this event is a ping, GeoChat indicates a chat type structure. The UID should be in the following format: GeoChat. . . . Diverging from this format should not cause significant issues; however, the UID is used as a fallback if other information cannot be parsed from the message, so issues may still be experienced. If uid does not contain any \u201c.\u201d characters, the chat room will default to \u201cAll Chat Rooms\u201d. GeoChat.ANDROID-7C:91:22:E8:6E:4D.DIPPER.44bf77cd-289e-4ea4-8756-ce295de168ca start format - DTG The \"start\" attribute defines the starting time of the event's validity interval. The start and stale fields together define an interval in time. It has the same format as time and stale. starting time of the event's validity interval (with respect to Zulu time in extended ISO 8601 format) . As different from the moment in which the element was generated in protobuff this is expressed in milliseconds access Specifies access controls that should be applied to the event opex OPTIONAL: Specifies whether the event is part of a live operation, an exercise, or a simulation.

Future version of the event schema will provide formal definition of this field. qos OPTIONAL: Specifies a quality of service desired from applications processing or routing the event ## filename ### filename attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## fillColor ### fillColor attributes Name Documentation value ## FilterGroup the name of the group authorized to see the CoT ### FilterGroup attributes ## group ### group attributes Name Documentation role name uid unique ID of the group ## hash ### hash attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## Hierarchy ### Hierarchy attributes ## IdentityTypes ### IdentityTypes attributes Name Documentation pending pending unknown unknown friend friend neutral hostile assumed-friend suspect joker faker ## image This is a Cursor On TargeClass for abstract image product metadata. It is specifically limited to geographically located (though not necessarily geographically registered) image products. It is not intended to contain all the meta data typically found in the NITF header associated with such images, but rather provides sufficient \"hints\" about the ISR product to facilitate collection queuing and ipl searching. Full meta data will reside in the NITF header or other IPL-specific schemas. This class borrows from the NITF standard. Note, also, that this class presumes is is contained within a CoT Evebnt element which provides information about center poiint, etc. Similarly, the CoT_shape schema can be used to delimit the bounds of the image. Furthermore, this element may conatin a base64 encoded image file. In this case, the 'mime' attribute should indicate the image type. ### image attributes Name Documentation type Image type, drawn from NITF specification. E.g., SL - side-looking radar, TI - thermal infrared, FL - forward looking infrared, RD - radar, EO - electro-optical, OP - optical, HR - high resolution radar, HS - hyperspectral, CP - color frame photography, BP - black/white frame photography, SAR - synthetic aperture radar, SARIQ - SAR radio hologram, IR - infrared, MS - multispectral, ... georegistered (DEPRECATED) True if this image has been properly geo-registered source (REVISED) The source of this image, specifically the CoT UID of the producer. (The intention is to indicate equipment type used to collect imagery, not organization owning image.) resolution Image product resolution (expressed in meters per pixel) url URL link to image if the image is not embedded version Version tag for this sub schema. Neccessary to ensure upward compatibility with future revisions. size Approximate image file size (bytes) analysis (DEPRECATED) True if image analysis (e.g., markup) is available mime If an in-lined image is contained in this entity, then this attribute describes the mime type of that image. The actual image data will be base64 encoded. See http://www.w3schools.com/media/media_mimeref.asp for list of common mime types. width The width of the image (in pixels) height The height of the image (in pixels) reason (NEW) The reason this image was originally produced (BHA, BDA, ISR, ...) Coding is TBD but will reflect the CoT type coding structure. E.g., a-d-b Assesment-Damage-Bomb, etc... bands Number of data bands within the image. For example, an RGB image as 3 bands (Red, Green, Blue bands/channels) mimecsv Used only if the attribute 'mime' references a container type (e.g., image/x-nitf21). In this case, 'mimecsv' holds a list of Comma Separated Values to supplement the MIME type in the mime field. Nominally, the values in 'mimecsv' wil lbe mime types of the elements in the composite image. For example, if 'mime' 'image/x-nitf21', then 'mimecsv' may hold 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpeg2000', or 'image/x-eagleeye'. quality This expresses how the tradeoff between image quality and compression were made for this image. This is usually a 'relative' quality measure, an unsigned floating point value between 0.0 (highest compression) and 0 (highest quality). Implementers should attempt to map this scalar value to an approximate linear progression of visual quality as determined on a typical sample image. If the field's value carries an explicit sign (+/-) including +0 or -0, it represents the exact value expressed in a range appropriate to the compression type expressed in 'mime' or 'mimecsv'. For example, with 'image/x-eagleeye' the EagleEye clip setting, the quality setting may range from -4096.0 to +4096.0. ## Input this class can drive input filtering without auth messages. ### Input attributes Name Documentation name Protocol Port auth Previously the only valid value for the \u201cauth\u201d attribute was \u201cldap\u201d. \u201cfile\u201d is now another valid value. ## keywords ### keywords attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## labels_on ### labels_on attributes Name Documentation value ## link This is a Cursor On Target Class for linking to either another CoT event or an arbitrary Internet resource. The objective of this class is to provide an abstract way to express a relationship between a CoT object and other object. This allows, for example, a sensor point of interest to be linked back to its source, or a PPLI from a wingman to be associated with his flight lead. Linkages are always unidirectional. One entity may have multiple links (i.e., it may be related to multiples other entities). For processing simplicity, it is required that the relationship graphs will directed and acyclic (no cycles). The link, itself, names the relationship (using a hierarchy similar to the CoT type), the UID of the related object (whether CoT or not), possibly provides a URL for retrieving that object. links are used for example in routes. ### link attributes Name Documentation uid production_time the time in which this link has been produced (e.g. \"2020-11-26T14:19:02Z\") relation The type of relationship (e.g, subject, object, indirect object) that this link describes. This is a hierarchy much like the event type field. Common values: \"c\" type The CoT type of the referenced MIL 2525 object. This is included because it is generally the key item needed in a tasking. Common types are: - Control Point: \"b-m-p-c\" - Waypoint : \"b-m-p-w\" url If present, this is a URL through which the linked object can be retrieved. If the URL is missing, then the object should be a periodic message (e.g., blue force track) that can be read from a CoT stream. parent_callsign the call sign of the client that produced this link remarks Remarks associated with this link. mime Internet Media type of the referenced object. If the link is to a CoT event, the mime attribute is optional and its type may be application/xml or text/xml as described in RFC 3023, \"XML Media Types\", or the unregistered type, application/cot+xml. If the link is to an arbitrary resource, the mime attribute is required and and appropriate Internet media type must be specified.

If this element is not included, the server will interpret this as a message to all recipients, and the message will be sent to everyone, and depending upon the client software, this could mean a private message would be displayed publicly. ### Marti attributes ## mimeType ### mimeType attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## mission ### mission attributes Name Documentation type tool name authorUid ## Mission Represent a TAK Mission ### Mission attributes Name Documentation name server description ## MissionChange ### MissionChange attributes ## MissionChanges ### MissionChanges attributes ## missionName ### missionName attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## MissionType ### MissionType attributes Name Documentation CREATE CHANGE ## name ### name attributes Name Documentation INTAG ## point ### point attributes Name Documentation lat Latitude referred to the WGS 84 ellipsoid in degrees lon Longitude referred to the WGS 84 in degrees ce Circular area around the point defined by lat and lon fields in meters. Although named ce, this field is intended to define a circular area around the event point, not necessarily an error (e.g. Describing a reservation area is not an \"error\"). If it is appropriate for the \"ce\" field to represent an error value (e.g. event describes laser designated target), the value will represent the one sigma point for a zero mean normal (Guassian) distribution. le Linear Error in meters associated with the HAE field. Although named le, this field is intended to define a height range about the event point, not necessarily an error. This field, along with the ce field allow for the definition of a cylindrical volume about the point. If it is appropriate for the \"le\" field to represent an error (e.g. event describes laser designated target), the value will represent the one sigma point for a zero mean normal (Guassian) distribution. A height range about the event point in meters associated with the HAE field. When used to represent error, the value represents the one sigma point for a zero mean normal (Gaussian) distribution. hae Height above Ellipsoid based on WGS-84 ellipsoid (measured in meters) HAE acronym for Height above Ellipsoid based on WGS-84 ellipsoid (measured in meters). ## polyline The poly line provides a mechanism to express arbitrarily complex two-dimenstional shapes. This is used for representing oddly shaped objects such as exclusion zones, etc. Though generally closed, it is not necessarily a closed line, thus allowing polyline to represent objects such as phasing lines, etc. ### polyline attributes Name Documentation vertex level \"level\" is used to indicate the preferred ordering of multiple shape sub-schemas. For instance, if a polyline and ellipse are both present on the shape attribute, the one with the higher level value will be the \"more desirable\" representation of the object. This allows producers to provide alternative representation of an objects shape while ensuring that consumers will know which of the available representation is the best. (Note that not all consumers will implement all shape variations, hence the need for the allowing multiple shape objects.) See the documentation for shape/ellipse/@level for remarks on determining the precedence order when level values are equal or are missing. closed True if the list of verticies should be considered a closed polygon (an implicit line will be added from vertex N to vertex 0). ## Precisionlocation some type of location? ### Precisionlocation attributes Name Documentation altsrc TDB can be DTED0 or ??? geopointsrc PRECISE_IMAGE_FILE PRECISE_IMAGE_FILE_X PRECISE_IMAGE_FILE_Y ## remarks This is a Cursor On TargetClass for a generic remarks (aka \"FreeText\"). Provides a place to annotate CoT with free text information. e.g. comments from other users about the current COT. Used also for the geoChat. the xml body of this class is used to transport the chat message While the use of free text is strongly discouraged (it hampers machine-to-machine communication) it is a pragmatic necessity. This entity attempts to encapsulate freetext in a way that simplifies subsequent machine processing. The content of this entity is presumed to be a human-readable chunk of textual data. The attributes merely aid in the machine handling of the data. ### remarks attributes Name Documentation time the time of the remark was added to the CoT object to Intended recipeint(s) of this remark information. Tentative field coding as follows: The to attribute may contain the UID of the entity to whom the message is addressed. (Implementors should expect that future versions of this sub schema will allow a comma separated list of UIDs.) Absense of an explict addressee means the message is broadcast. e.g. ANDROID-359975090666199 source Source specifies the sender\u2019s UID \u2013 this is what is parsed by recipients to determine the sender, with the UID format being the fallback. version Version tag for this sub schema.

This schema contains information common to all requests, specifically where responses should be sent, the overall priority of the request, if immediate willco/cantco acknowledgement is needed, etc. Detail information for specific request types are carried in sub-schemas nested within this one. Notice that this is not the same as in TAKRequest ### request attributes Name Documentation notify Network endpoint to which status notifications should be delivered.

The previous format, host:port, e.g., 192.168.0.1:71556, is deprecated, but implementers should be aware that this format may be in use. wilcoby An optional field that requests the receiving system to provide a positive or negative akcnowledgement (WILCO/CANTCO) by a specific time. This is used to ensure that deadline driven requests are made known to the operator. priority This optional field indicates this request's relative priority with respect to other requests.

However, it is counterproductive to burden all CoT applications to understand arbitrary shapes, so \"shape\" is an optional attribute that can be used to communicate between shape-aware apprications. The \"point\" object in the base schema must still be populated and the CE and LE fields in the point entity must be set such that the point completely encloses the area described in any shape entity in the detail section. (This is needed so that CoT applications can quickly filter out objects that are clearly outside an area of interest. ### shape attributes Name Documentation ellipse The \"ellipse\" is a common shape abstraction used by many geomanipulation applications; it is supported natively. link polyline The poly line provides a mechanism to express arbitrarily complex two-dimenstional shapes. This is used for representing oddly shaped objects such as exclusion zones, etc. Though generally closed, it is not necessarily a closed line, thus allowing polyline to represent objects such as phasing lines, etc. dxf This is a hook for an arbitrary 3D DXF description of a volume of space. version Version tag for this sub schema.

This 'uid' entity provides a common place where each systems can record its particular UID for each CoT event. Like the _flow-tags_ element, each system is responsible for adding its own attribute to this entity.

An event may describe a physical object, a set of raw, unprocessed bits, or a tasking. Hierarchically organized hint about event type The \"type\" attribute is a composite of components delimited by the semi-colon character (e.g. 'a-f-G-I' for \"Friendly Ground infrastructure). The first component of this composite attribute is defined below. Future versions of this schema will define other components which we expect will aid in machine filtering. Despite the exclusion of definitions for additional components in this version of the schema, users of this schema should expect and design an optional trailing field delimited by the semi-colon character. This field can be ignored. component1;optional field The first component (component1) is a hierarchically organized hint about type. The intention is that this hierarchy be flexible and extensible and facilitate simple filtering, translation and display. To facilitate filtering, the hierarchy needs to present key fields in an easily parsed and logical order. To facilitate this, this component is a composite of fields separated by the \"-\" punctuation character, so a valid type would be: x-x-X-X-x. Using a punctuation for field separation allows arbitrary expansion of the type space, e.g., a-fzp-mlk-gm-... Field meanings are type specific. That is, the third field of an \"atom\" type may represent air vs. ground while the same field for a \"reservation\" type may represent purpose. MEANING of 'a' in the first position The \"Atoms\" portion of the type tree requires some additional explanation past the taxonomy defined below. The \"Atoms\" portion of the type tree contains CoT defined fields and part of the MIL-STD-2525 type definition. To distinguish MIL-STD-2525 type strings from CoT defined fields, the MIL-STD-2525 types must be represented in all upper case. Differentiation of type namespace with upper/lower case facilitates extension of CoT types and MIL-STD-2525 types without name space conflict. An example: a-f-A-B-C-x ``` * a = Atom * f = attitude or disposition (friendly in this case) * A-B-C =the symbol identification coding (SIDC) scheme for 2525 \u2013 a strings of 15 characters used to transmit symbols. * x = non capital COT specific extension The organization of CoT and MIL-STD-2525 types can be determined from the taxonomy, but additional details are provided here. The \"Atoms\" portion of the \"type\" tree contains the \"Battle Dimension\" and \"Function ID\" fields taken from MIL-STD-2525 (see below). \"Battle Dimension\" is a single character taken from MIL-STD-2525 and is located in the position 5. a-.- G -I-M-N-B ``` The typical 2525 representation for \"Function ID\" is three groups of two characters separated by a space (e.g. \"12 34 56\"). The CoT schema maps this to a \"-\" delimited list of characters. (e.g. \"1-2-3-4-5-6\"). The concatenation of the \"Battle Dimension\" and \"Function ID\" fields from the MIL-STD-2525 specification represented in the CoT schema will be as follows: battle dimension-func id char1-func id char2- ... -func id char6 When an appropriate MIL-STD-2525 type exists, it should be used. If there is a MIL-STD-2525 representation which is close, but may be refined, a CoT extension to the 2525 type can be appended. For example: a-h-X-X-X-X-X-i might represent hostile MIL-STD-2525 type X-X-X-X-X of Israeli (the 'i') manufacture. Again, the CoT extension uses lower case. Conceptually, this extension defines further branching from the nearest MIL-STD-2525 tree point. If no appropriate 2525 representation exists, a type definition can be added to the CoT tree defined here. The resulting definition would be represented in all lower case. For example a-h-G-p-i might define atoms-hostile-Ground-photon cannon-infrared.

However, tracks derived from such sources represent objects on the battlespace and this have event type \"A-...\" The intention with the \"Bit\" type is to facilitate the identification of germane information products.

The script can also be used to upgrade an existing install when a new release is available. Running the following command will download and run the script. If you want to review the contents of the script first, you can view it on Github. bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered) Enable service so that starts automagically: sudo systemctl enable nodered.service Run the Node-RED service: node-red-start Navigate to your Node-RED: http://<IP>:1880 Install Using APT (advanced users) To install Node-RED with APT you will need to: - Satisfy the requirements - Create a Non root user - Install Node JS Prerequisites This guide assumes that you are using Ubuntu 20.04 on cloud installation (we use digital Ocean). Create a Non-root user First create a special user and dedicated group: sudo useradd -m nodered -G nodered Install Node JS you can use the apt package manager. Refresh your local package index first by typing: sudo apt update Then install Node.js: sudo apt install nodejs ``` Check that the install was successful by querying node for its version number: node -v ``` Output something like this v10.19.0 If the package in the repositories suits your needs, this is all you need to do to get set up with Node.js. In most cases, you\u2019ll also want to also install npm, the Node.js package manager. You can do this by installing the npm package with apt: sudo apt install npm This will allow you to install modules and packages to use with Node.js. Install Node-RED Use npm to install node-red and a helper utility called node-red-admin. sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red node-red-admin npm normally installs its packages into your current directory. Here, we use the -g flag to install packages \u2018globally\u2019 so they\u2019re placed in standard system locations such as /usr/local/bin. The --unsafe-perm flag helps us avoid some errors that can pop up when npm tries to compile native modules (modules written in a compiled language such as C or C++ vs. JavaScript). After a bit of downloading and file shuffling, you\u2019ll be returned to the normal command line prompt. Let\u2019s test our install. First, we\u2019ll need to open up a port on our firewall. Node-RED defaults to using port 1880, so let\u2019s allow that. sudo ufw allow 1880 And now launch Node-RED itself.

Cloud - A Digital Ocean (DO) or other virtually hosted server will allow quickest deployment and is scalable to as many users as you wish 2. LAN - An RPi server located on your home/office LAN may require additional complexities for non-LAN TAK clients to access your server, e.g. dynamic DNS services (noip.com) and NAT port forwarding. 3. VPN - An RPi server running as a ZeroTier (or other SD-WAN) client will mostly circumvent the need for the complexities listed above and allow any TAK client on the ZeroTier network to access the RPi server regardless of internet connection method (broadband, cellular data, etc.) 4. Edge - An RPi server running on an ad hoc or local infrastructure LAN configuration \u2013 Can be setup completely off-grid and without reliance on a functioning internet, but will suffer significant limitations in range for TAK clients to connect. 5. Hybrid off-grid \u2013 A DO installed server or RPi with one or more of the TAK clients connected as a \u201cbridge\u201d to an off-grid mesh network such as Meshtastic LoRa. This configuration will allow any off-grid Meshtastic clients to have their communications reach all \u201cinternet-connected\u201d TAK clients via a TAK client who is simultaneously connected to both the internet and mesh sides of the network.","title":"TAK Infrastructure"},{"location":"Installation/Video%20Guides/","text":"Official FreeTAKTeam channel FreeTAKTeam youtube channel RPiFTS Series GHOST_DA-B6 has created a set of videos on youtube detailing how to install and set up 1.5 FTS on raspberry pi SBC's.

On the top of the window you will see two buttons. a list of active checklists shows up below them. with the buttons You can: - create a new Template - create a new template based on an existing one - Join active checklist - Start a new checklist create a new Template You need to define a name , a description and at least a task, to be able to save the template. standard columns can be modified or deleted, - No: sequence of the task - Description: name of the task - Req. : this step is required to complete the checklist (???) - Callsign: TBD - Net: TBD - From: TBD - To: TBD - Codeword: a code word for this task - Due relative DTG: the timing of the completition of the task required field after that you have created a task you can righ click the hamburger menu (the 3 lines) to the left to: - Delete the task - add some background color - Toggle linebreak: allows to create a block of tasks create a new template based on an existing one Works like the previous, only you will start the template by modifying an existing one Start a new checklist When you start a new checklist, the current status is saved locally and on the server. Join active checklist Allow you to participate with others in completing the checklist. Working with checklists As soon a checklist is started, you can click on an action and set it to be completed. You can also set back to pending a completed item. It's also possible to add Notes (those are only visible opening the task item) If another team member changes the status of a task, you will get an update. to delete a checklist, you need to open it and pres the delete button ATAK the plugin for ATAK is yet not available to the community (Dec 2020).

FTS supports SSL since version 1.3. Automated SSL Generation and Deployment Since version 1.5, FTS features automated SSL generation and deployment. The automated generation and deployment is easier, please consider using that approach. For more details, read the FTS manual here . Expected File Structure Manual SSL Installation Guide This method requires understanding of complex console commands. We do not provide support for certificate generation or deployment issues. We are currently exploring tools like YAOG to simplify the process. Some of the steps below to create a server and client certificate are adopted from: https://blog.devolutions.net/2020/07/tutorial-how-to-generate-secure-self-signed-server-and-client-certificates-with-openssl/ 1. Install OpenSSL on Windows using the choco package manager Go to: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup#installing-chocolatey and install the choco package manager. Next, temporarily append the choco executable to the PATH variable. After PowerShell is closed, the appended path will resort back to its original state. $env:Path += \";C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\" To permanently add to the PATH variable, refer to: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm Next, install OpenSSL: choco install openssl Do not close PowerShell because you will need it for the next steps. 2. Add OpenSSL to the PATH Most likely, you will be running a 64-bit system. For a 64-bit system, enter: $env:Path += \";C:\\Program Files\\OpenSSL-Win64\\bin\" For a 32-bit system (unlikely), enter: $env:Path += \";C:\\Program Files\\OpenSSL-Win32\\bin\" 3. Set up a directory for OpenSSL outputs Go to your home directory. cd ~ Make an invisible folder called .certs . mkdir .certs Go into the .certs directory. cd .certs 4. Generate the Certificate Authority Certificate Create a private key for the CA certifcate. openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ca.key A ca.key will be outputted to the directory: Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 ca.key Next, create CA certificate from the newly created private key. openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key ca.key -out ca.crt You will be prompted to enter in certificate details. Here is an example: You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank. ----- Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:CA Locality Name (eg, city) []:Los Angeles Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Acme Corporation Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Dev Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Wile E. Coyote Email Address []:wile@acmecorp.com A ca.crt will be outputted to the directory. Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 944 ca.crt -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 ca.key 5. Generate the Server Certificate Generate the server private key. openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out server.key A server.key will be outputted to the directory: Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 944 ca.crt -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 ca.key -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 server.key Next, generate the server certificate signing request. openssl req -new -sha256 -key server.key -out server.csr You will be prompted to enter in certificate details.

Generate the Client Certificate These are the same steps as above, except for the client. Generate the server private key. openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out client.key A client.key will be outputted to the directory: Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 944 ca.crt -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 ca.key -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 42 ca.srl -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 client.key -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 820 server.crt -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 382 server.csr -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 server.key Next, generate the client certificate signing request. openssl req -new -sha256 -key client.key -out client.csr You will be prompted to enter in certificate details.

Make sure you have JRE installed For example, install JRE8 if you do not have it installed: choco install jre8 8. Add the JRE bin folder to the PATH Go into the Java folder: cd \"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\\" Find the JRE folder: dir which will output something like: Directory: C:\\Program Files\\Java Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- d----- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM jre1.8.0_311 Go into the JRE folder: NOTE: Your JRE may be a different version cd jre1.8.0_311 Go into the bin directory: cd bin Output the absolute path of this directory: pwd which will output out something like: Path ---- C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_311\\bin Add this directory to the PATH: $env:Path += \";C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_311\\bin\" Now go back to your .certs folder: cd ~\\.certs\\ 9. Generate the keystore Enter this command to generate the keystore: keytool -genkey -v -keystore fts.keystore -alias fts -storetype PKCS12 -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 You will be prompted to enter in keystore details. Here is an example: Enter keystore password: badpassword Re-enter new password: badpassword What is your first and last name? [Unknown]: Wile Coyote What is the name of your organizational unit?
